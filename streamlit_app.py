    Created by [Aman Deva](https://github.com/AmanDeva) and [Kirtiman Dubey](https://github.com/dubeykirtiman)
    
    This project aims to **automate content moderation** to identify hate speech using **machine learning binary classification algorithms.**
    
    Models included Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The final model was a **Logistic Regression** model that used Count Vectorization for feature engineering. It produced an F1 of 0.9616 and Recall (TPR) of 0.9363.  
    
    Check out the project repository [here](https://github.com/AmanDeva/twitter-hate-speech-detector..git).

    **Human content moderation exploits people by consistently traumatizing and underpaying them.** In 2019, an [article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) on The Verge exposed the extensive list of horrific working conditions that employees faced at Cognizant, which was Facebook’s primary moderation contractor. Unfortunately, **every major tech company**, including **Twitter**, uses human moderators to some extent, both domestically and overseas.
    
    Hate speech is defined as **abusive or threatening speech that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion, or sexual orientation.**
